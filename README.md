# spectrometer

Software package for a custom spectrometer used for labs and simple experiments. Once the spectrometer's webcam is plugged into a USB port, wimply run webcam.py and point the spectrometer towards a light source. Spectral pattern will appear in the green box on the camera feed. Once satisfied with the image, hit Space to capture and analyze the spectral lines.

Below is an example of the sodium spectral lines captured by the spectrometer and process by the software.
